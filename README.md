# Project Name: The Final Print

## Project Description 

### What is the project: 
*The Final Print* is an audio experience that uses sound to tell a classic sci-fi horror story about a machine coming to life. The story follows two college students as they try to print out papers for their professor, only for things to go horribly wrong when the machine comes to life. The project aims to bring attention to environmental concerns through its narrative, dialogue, and message.

### What is the overall concept and theme:
The story explores themes of humanity's disregard and negative impact on the environment. The concept of a machine coming to life highlights the consequences of human negligence and how our creations harm the planet. The production of machines requires significant energy, leading to environmental degradation. Additionally, a printer requires paper, contributing further to environmental harm—a never-ending cycle.

### What kind of experience we were striving to create:
Through this audio piece, we aim to raise awareness of the negative effects of irresponsible consumption and promote resource preservation. To create a unique and immersive experience emphasizing the printer’s transformation from an “old” machine to a “monster” as a symbol of nature’s constraints due to human selfishness, we combined originally recorded sounds, enhanced them, and added effects using Audacity and online AI tools.

## Roles 

Each group member contributed their unique skills to this project, collaborating effectively across various aspects of the production:

- **Recording**: Anastasia, Maliha, and Alua captured the original audio, including dialogue and sounds.
- **Equipment**: Maliha managed the booking and handling of recording equipment.
- **Story Development**: The entire team (Alua, Maliha, Anastasia, and Ghaya) conceptualized the storyline, focusing on the environmental message and emotional depth.
- **Script Writing**: Ghaya and Maliha worked on scripting, refining the dialogue and scene sequence.
- **Audio Editing**: Alua and Ghaya combined all recorded sounds and created the final audio using Audacity.
- **Web Implementation**: Maliha led the web development, ensuring the site design matched the tone of the audio and offered a seamless user experience.

## Process

### Developing the Story and Writing the Script
We brainstormed ideas to best convey the message of environmental responsibility and waste. This led us to craft a story about an everyday activity—printing a paper—that turns into a profound message. Our team then scripted characters with differing opinions on waste, adding depth and structure with a clear beginning, middle, and end.

### Sound Recording and Editing
We recorded a range of sounds from different resources to create an immersive audio experience. All character conversations were originally recorded, and we even gave a voice to the printer, recording its dialogue.

We used mechanical sounds from open sources (pressing printer buttons, printing sounds, footsteps). To portray the printer’s transformation, we enhanced recorded sounds with AI tools, creating a robotic voice that grows distorted and glitchy, marking the printer’s shift from a compliant machine to an angry “monster” reacting to wasteful human behavior.

### Soundscape and Effects
To add depth and realism, we layered sound effects using Audacity. Key sound components included:
- A low humming as the printer “awakens.”
- Louder beeps, clinks, and noises as it malfunctions.
- The printer’s roboticized voice as it starts speaking.

These layers heightened the story’s tension and guided listeners through an immersive experience.

### Web Page Design and User Experience
We designed a website in a pixel art style, resembling a retro video game, to engage viewers with nature in a playful, nostalgic way. The pixelated aesthetic encourages users to engage with the content and consider environmental issues from a familiar, playful perspective. Every element on the site was hand-drawn using Procreate, Ibis Paint X, and Photoshop.

## Problems

Throughout the process, we faced challenges at different stages of project development. Booking audio equipment was initially difficult due to high demand, delaying some recording sessions. Once we had the equipment, we dealt with audio issues, including background noise and unbalanced volumes. Creating a believable, scary robotic voice for the printer was challenging, requiring various effects to strike a balance between mechanical realism and fear. We also struggled to find suitable background sounds to create an alarming yet engaging soundscape that effectively reinforced the story.

For the website, maintaining sharp pixel visuals across screen resolutions required careful CSS adjustments. Browser inconsistencies impacted color accuracy, leading us to test different color profiles. We also optimized the unique graphics to improve load times, despite the large number of visuals. These efforts ensured that the pixel art design effectively supported our project’s message.

Despite these challenges, we refined each element to create a project that effectively delivered our intended message.

## Reflection/Evaluation

Our initial goal for *The Final Print* was to use a relatable scenario to creatively explore ecological awareness. We wanted to make listeners think about how their daily actions affect our planet, crafting an unexpected journey that transforms an ordinary machine into a symbol of natural boundaries. By combining edited soundscapes with original recordings, we created a unique blend of reality and fiction.

We experimented with effects to give the printer’s voice a robotic yet expressive quality and matched sounds to the script to maintain a consistent pace. Each element was carefully crafted to complement the sound without overshadowing the environmental message.

The final project exceeded our expectations in combining sound and narrative. The pixel art website enhances the story flow, visually engaging the listener, while the audio journey presents a meaningful message. This experience strengthened our understanding of the narrative potential of sound and visuals, reinforcing our commitment to connecting environmental issues with personal responsibility.
